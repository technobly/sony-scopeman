# Vectorboy v1.0 PCB & BOM

Everything you need to order parts for your Sony Scopeman / Vectorboy!

## PCB

:warning: **NOTE: Be sure to order the PCB thinner than standard, 0.040" (1.0mm) should be good.**  If you end up ordering as 0.062" (1.6mm), [you will have to make a bunch of modifications, but it can be done.](thick-pcb-mods.md)

### JLCPCB

All parts including PCB's for 2 complete boards was $159.82 ($80 each).

I got a brand new Sony Watchman FD-10A from eBay for $30 shipped.

I made some minor tweaks to the silkscreen and ordered PCBs from JLCPCB.

- Added "JLCJLCJLCJLC" to the back side of the PCB for part number placement
- Moved "PURPLE / BLACK" text for readability 
- Changed main text to say "Vectorboy v1.0" for fun and motivation
- I ordered 20 PCBs in White soldermask with Black silkscreen with a stencil for $34.38 shipped.

Order PCB's by using the included [gerbers-vectorboy-v1.0.zip](../gerber-vectorboy-V1.0/) and uploading those with all of the necessary specs [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)

## BOM

### LCSC

Most of the parts are included in [LCSC-Bom-Vectorboy-v1.0.csv](LCSC-Bom-Vectorboy-v1.0.csv)

However, some of those parts were out of stock and I had to get them at Digikey or eBay.

Here is the exact order that was exported

- [LCSC-Exported-Vectorboy-v1.0.csv](LCSC-Exported-Vectorboy-v1.0.csv) - $33.14

To import this:

- Upload the CSV to [LCSC's BOM Tool](https://lcsc.com/bom)
- Set the columns for "LCSC Part Number", "Customer Part Number" (these are the ref des.), "Quantity"
- This will add enough parts for 2 complete boards (adjust as necessary)

### Digikey

A few parts needed to be ordered from Digikey

- [Here's the shared cart](https://www.digikey.com/short/332bzwh8) - $44.50
